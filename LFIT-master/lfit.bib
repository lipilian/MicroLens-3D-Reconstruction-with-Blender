abstract = "Abstract The Light-Field Imaging Toolkit (LFIT) is a collection of \{MATLAB\} functions designed to facilitate the rapid processing of raw light field images captured by a plenoptic camera. An included graphical user interface streamlines the necessary post-processing steps associated with plenoptic images. The generation of perspective shifted views and computationally refocused images is supported, in both single image and animated formats. \{LFIT\} performs necessary calibration, interpolation, and structuring steps to enable future applications of this technology."
