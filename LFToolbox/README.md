# Light Field Toolbox for MATLAB

Copyright (c) 2013-2020 Donald G. Dansereau

This is a toolbox for working with light field imagery in MATLAB. Features include loading, visualizing, and filtering light fields, and decoding, calibration, and rectification of lenslet-based imagery.

The most recent release and development versions are here: [https://github.com/doda42/LFToolbox](https://github.com/doda42/LFToolbox).

The complementary LiFF light field feature toolbox is here: [http://dgd.vision/Tools/LiFF](http://dgd.vision/Tools/LiFF)

## Installation and Sample Data
Please refer to LFToolbox.pdf for installation and usage instructions.

## What's New / Development Plan
v0.5.1: bug fixes, documentation improvements, see CHANGELOG.txt

v0.5 introduces new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements. Highlights:
* Linear refocus super-resolution using LFFiltShiftSum.
* New display functions LFDispLawnmower, LFDispTiles, LFDispTilesSubfigs, LFDispProj, LFDispProjSubfigs
* LFReadESLF, LFWriteESLF
* Improved decode performance and speed
* Improved calibration accuracy
* LFDisp* functions are better behaved, now display in the active figure window

For a complete list, see CHANGELOG.txt.

Future plans include more significant changes to lenslet-based decode and calibration, and support for a broader range of cameras.

## Compatibility

**Reverse-compatibility**: Changes to interfaces have been minimised, LFDispVidCirc is the main exception, with a new parameter structure.

Previously generated calibration files should be re-generated, and to benefit from performance improvements to decoding, white images should be re-generated. See LFToolbox.pdf for details.

**Matlab**: LFToolbox 0.5 was written in MATLAB 2020a, but should be compatible with earlier versions.

**File Formats**: The toolbox can load gantry / array-style folders of images, ESLF files, and raw lenslet-based images.

**Plenoptic 1.0** cameras are supported through decoding, calibration, and rectification of imagery. Functions are most easily applied to Lytro imagery. The toolbox can also be applied to other lenslet-based Plenoptic 1.0 cameras, but this is not yet well documented. Calibration of Lytro Illum cameras is experimental.

**Plenoptic 2.0** cameras are not well supported. Use with some cameras is possible but not well documented. Multi-focal lenslet-based cameras are not well supported.

**Lytro Software**: The toolbox is compatible with files generated using Lytro Desktop 4 and 3, and will load ESLF files generated using the Lytro Power Tools.

## Contributing / Feedback
Suggestions, bug reports, code improvements and new functionality are welcome -- email Donald.Dansereau+LFToolbox {at} gmail dot com.

## Branch Structure
* tags: keep track of each release
* master: always the most recent release
* develop<version #>: developing new functionality for specific release
* develop: experimental functionality
* release<version #>: soon-to-be-released branch, to be merged into master

Code in the develop branches is incomplete, unstable, undocumented, and unsupported. Use at your own risk. Functions named LFX* are new/experimental.
